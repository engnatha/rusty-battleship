# Rusty Battleship

## Background
Rust is a modern, performant, versatile language. Most of my experience has
been in Python and I have been looking for opportunities to expand my skill
set. After recently playing
[Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)), I thought it
would be a great project to take on. The concept of the game is quite simple,
but programming it will require concepts like custom data structures, input
validation, terminal display, and hopefully much more.

Before taking this project on, I started getting exposed to the language by
reading through the [online book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) provided by
the developers. It gives great exposure and examples in a very intuitive way. I
would encourage anyone else new to the language to use it as a starting point
as well.

## How To Run
Stay tuned as this project gets built up! This project will be managed using
[Bazel](https://bazel.build/) and commands will be provided to run from source.

If all goes well, a Docker container will also be made available.
